# Knee Arthroplasty Rehabilitation – Early Strength and Mobility Recovery

Goal: Restore knee joint mobility, improve quadriceps and hip muscle strength, and enhance lower limb function following knee arthroplasty.

Duration / Frequency: 4 to 6 weeks, perform exercises 3 to 5 times per week, each session lasting approximately 20–30 minutes.

Tips: Complete exercises in the prescribed order. Maintain controlled, smooth movements and avoid pain during exercises. Rest 30–60 seconds between sets. Use support (chair or wall) as needed for balance during standing exercises.

Consistency and patience are key to your recovery. Regularly performing these exercises will help you regain strength and mobility safely and effectively.
